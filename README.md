A simple browser game that mimics the "tag" mechanics but with a twist. The game is written in plain JavaScript.

As soon as the game starts, the player is being chased by the enemy entity. The movement mimics Pac Man but if the player touches a wall, he then gets slowed
and needs to hold the momevent button to pass through the obstacle. If the player tries to get out of the map, their position resets to the starting position (use this wisely)


TO-DO:
- Add images to the game
- Add more maps and different types of enemies
- Add a game description
